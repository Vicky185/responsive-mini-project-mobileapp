# Responsive mini project 
## A test of mobile-first approach

In this we used html5, css and mobile-first approach. 

We needed to understand how to style an application on a mobile with the <main>, <header>, <footer> and <section> elements. We also used articles and asides. 
This was done to create the layout and re-familiarise ourselves with the layout and size of screen when creating an application. 

### Lessons learned

* how to improve something
* how to make the layout neater 
* using media queries to tailor the layout according to screen size
* using paragraphs in articles and asides
* using HTML shortcuts
* as you go along, you're not leaving the styles you've created behind, you revisit to edit and hone the craft. I.e. in this project we revisited other and further uses of media queries and how the columns interacted and changed according to screen size


This new skill will act as a tool for your labs, challenges, and projects as you progress through the program.
